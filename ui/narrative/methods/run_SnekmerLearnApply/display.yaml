            Protein Fasta
        short-hint : |
            Each sequence within this file will be annotated using Snekmer Apply with TIGRFAMs annotations.

        ui-name : |
            Kmer Length
        short-hint : |
            Length Kmers should be set to. Recommendation varies depending on alphabet.
    alphabet :
        ui-name : |
            Amino Acid Re-encoding Alphabet
        short-hint : |
            Amino acids are re-encoded based on different properties such has hydrophobicity or solvent accessibility. 
description : |
    <p>The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. Protein FASTA files). Snekmer uses cosine distance to predict the annotation of each sequence from the pre-built kmer counts matrix. The output is a table for each file containing sequence annotation predictions with confidence levels.</p>
