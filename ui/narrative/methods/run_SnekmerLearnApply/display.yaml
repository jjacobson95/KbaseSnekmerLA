description : |
    <p>The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. Protein FASTA files). Snekmer uses cosine distance to predict the annotation of each sequence from the pre-built kmer counts matrix. The output is a table for each file containing sequence annotation predictions with confidence levels.</p>
