    <p>This App leverages <a href="https://snekmer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Snekmer</a> for its Apply function, a powerful tool designed to process sequences into kmers and predict protein sequence function. The Apply function utilizes pre-built kmer counts matrices from 1000 InterPro genomes for TIGRFams, Pfam, and PANTHER annotations.</p>
    <p> The kmerized protein sequences are compared to each family in the prebuilt matrices using cosine similarity to find the most likely function. Cosine similarity is a similarity metric that vectorizes objects into N dimensions, where N is the number of kmers, and then measures the angle between the vectors. It is commonly used in text analysis.</p> 
    <p> The prebuilt kmer count matrices were created using Snekmer Learn, a feature not yet available to KBase.</p>
    <p><h4>Snekmer Apply Key Features:</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rapid Annotation:</b> Using pre-built counts matrices mentioned above, Snekmer Apply utilizes cosine similarity to predict the annotation ontology.</li>
        <li><b>Efficient Data Handling:</b> Optimized to manage and analyze Genome and ProteinSequenceSet Obects effectively.</li>
        <li><b>Integration of Comprehensive Databases:</b> Incorporates annotations from TIGRFams, Pfam, and PANTHER, covering a wide range of genomic features.</li>
        <li><b>Seamless Workflow Integration:</b> Designed to complement and integrate with other genomic analysis tools available in KBase, enhancing overall research capabilities.</li>
        <li><b>Detailed Output:</b> While updating object ontologies, this tool also generates a secondary output with detailed results of prediction confidence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> The output of Snekmer Apply is an updated object with new protein sequence / gene ontologies. The secondary output provides predictions and confidence levels which may be directly downloaded.</p>
